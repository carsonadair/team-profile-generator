# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

In this project I created a nodejs command line application that receives information about a team project with various employees, then generates the information into a HTML file. 

Employee types can be manager, engineer, or intern, and each has specific identifiers such as office number, github, or school respectivly. Along with this, their emails, ID numbers, and positions are also collected and displayed on the generated page. 

Each piece of this project is tested to ensure it works. The test can be run with the command line ```npm test```. 

Below is a link to a video to the completed application.
